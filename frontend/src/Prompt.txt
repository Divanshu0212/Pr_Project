ðŸš€ Final Action Plan: Integrating Frontend & Syncing Backend
Here is your comprehensive, step-by-step plan to finalize your TrackFolio project. We'll ensure frontend components correctly interact, data persists, and the user flow is intuitive.

Phase 1: Frontend Integration & Bug Fixes (Your Action)
This phase focuses on making your existing and newly generated frontend components work together seamlessly.

ðŸ“‹ STEP 1: Update pages/portfolio/PortfolioHome.jsx
Goal: Ensure the main Portfolio dashboard correctly navigates to the new dedicated pages and removes redundant tab content.
Files to Update: src/pages/portfolio/PortfolioHome.jsx
Prompt for AI:

Plaintext

Please provide the complete, corrected content for `src/pages/portfolio/PortfolioHome.jsx`.

The component should:
- Have all `Maps('/portfolioHome')` calls changed to `Maps('/portfolio')`.
- Have all `Maps('/portfolio/add')` calls changed to `Maps('/portfolio/projects/add')`.
- Have all `Maps('/portfolio/tracking')` calls changed to `Maps('/portfolio/projects')`.
- For the "Profile Completion" section's "Complete Profile" button, it should navigate to `/portfolio/settings`.
- For the "Navigation Tabs" section:
    - The "overview" button should set `activeSection('overview')` (staying on the current page).
    - The "projects" button should `Maps('/portfolio/projects')`.
    - The "skills" button should `Maps('/portfolio/skills')`.
    - The "certificates" button should `Maps('/portfolio/certificates')`.
    - The "experience" button should `Maps('/portfolio/experience')`.
- The `main-content` section should **only render the `overview-section`** when `activeSection === 'overview'`. All other `activeSection === 'projects'`, `activeSection === 'skills'`, `activeSection === 'certificates'`, `activeSection === 'experience'` blocks (which previously contained the full content for those tabs) should be **removed**, as these are now handled by separate pages.
- Ensure all other existing functionalities (profile picture upload/delete, stats, profile actions like Preview/Share/Export PDF) remain intact. The "Share" action should correctly point to the public portfolio URL `/portfolio/public/:username`.

**Reference files needed (context):**
- `src/context/AuthContext.jsx` (for `currentUser`, `portfolioDetails`, `setCurrentUser`)
- `src/context/ThemeContext.jsx` (for `useTheme`)
- `src/config/index.js` (for `SummaryApi` endpoints)
- `src/pages/portfolio/PortfolioDetailsForm.jsx` (for `PortfolioDetailsForm` modal)
- `src/components/portfolio/ProjectCard.jsx` (for preview display)
- `src/components/portfolio/CertificateCard.jsx` (for preview display)
- `src/components/portfolio/AddCertificateForm.jsx` (for modal)
- `src/components/portfolio/ExperienceTab.jsx` (for preview display)
ðŸ“‹ STEP 2: Update pages/portfolio/ProjectDetails.jsx
Goal: Ensure project details are correctly fetched/displayed and navigation paths are accurate.
Files to Update: src/pages/portfolio/ProjectDetails.jsx
Issue Addressed: "the details of project are not being stored" (This refers to fetching existing details, not storing new ones. This component already fetches by id, so the issue is likely on the backend's getProject endpoint or SummaryApi config, which we'll address in the backend phase. Here we just ensure the frontend code is correct).
Prompt for AI:

Plaintext

Please provide the complete, corrected content for `src/pages/portfolio/ProjectDetails.jsx`.

The component should:
- Ensure all `Maps('/portfolioHome')` calls are changed to `Maps('/portfolio')`.
- Ensure the `Link` to edit (`/portfolio/edit/:id`) is changed to `to={`/portfolio/projects/edit/${project._id}`}`.
- All existing data fetching (`useQuery`), loading, error, and deletion logic must remain intact.
- All existing styling and animation logic must remain intact.

**Reference files needed (context):**
- `src/config/index.js` (for `SummaryApi.projects` endpoints)
- `src/context/ThemeContext.jsx` (for `useTheme`)
ðŸ“‹ STEP 3: Update pages/portfolio/ProjectTracking.jsx
Goal: Ensure the full project list correctly navigates to other project-related pages.
Files to Update: src/pages/portfolio/ProjectTracking.jsx
Prompt for AI:

Plaintext

Please provide the complete, corrected content for `src/pages/portfolio/ProjectTracking.jsx`.

The component should:
- Ensure the "Back to Portfolio" button navigates to `Maps('/portfolio')`.
- Ensure the "Add Project" button navigates to `Maps('/portfolio/projects/add')`.
- Confirm that each `ProjectCard` component (which is rendered in the grid) correctly links to `to={`/portfolio/projects/${project._id}`}` internally. (This is handled by the `ProjectCard` component itself, just a note here).
- All existing data fetching (`useQuery`), filtering, loading, error, and empty state logic must remain intact.
- All existing styling must remain intact.

**Reference files needed (context):**
- `src/config/index.js` (for `SummaryApi.projects` endpoints)
- `src/components/portfolio/ProjectCard.jsx`
ðŸ“‹ STEP 4: Update components/portfolio/SkillManagement.jsx
Goal: Fix the issue where skills updates/adds aren't immediately reflected and ensure edit button works.
Files to Update: src/components/portfolio/SkillManagement.jsx
Issue Addressed: "edit skill option not there", "on the /skills page the added skills are not being updated on the /skills page, only updated on the portfolioHome page"
Prompt for AI:

Plaintext

Please provide the complete, corrected content for `src/components/portfolio/SkillManagement.jsx`.

The component should:
- Ensure the "Edit" button for each skill correctly sets `isEditing(true)` and `editingSkill` state, and the `Modal` correctly displays the `editingSkill` data.
- The "Save" button within the edit modal should trigger `onSubmitUpdateSkill` which invalidates the `skills` query cache to force a re-fetch, ensuring the list updates immediately.
- The "Add Skill" button's associated mutation (`addSkillMutation`) should also invalidate the `skills` query cache (`queryClient.invalidateQueries(['skills'])`) on `onSuccess` to ensure the list updates immediately after a new skill is added.
- The "Delete" skill button's mutation (`deleteSkillMutation`) should also invalidate the `skills` query cache on `onSuccess`.
- Ensure the "Back to Portfolio" button navigates to `Maps('/portfolio')`.
- All other existing functionalities (drag-and-drop reordering, loading/error states, input handling, modal logic) must remain intact.

**Reference files needed (context):**
- `src/config/index.js` (for `SummaryApi.skills` endpoints)
- `src/context/AuthContext.jsx`
- `src/context/ThemeContext.jsx`
- `src/components/common/Button.jsx`
- `src/components/common/Card.jsx`
- `src/components/common/Form.jsx` (with Input, Select, Checkbox sub-components)
- `src/components/common/Modal.jsx`
- `src/components/common/Loader.jsx`
- `clsx` library.
ðŸ“‹ STEP 5: Update components/portfolio/AddCertificateForm.jsx
Goal: Fix the issue where the "Add Certificate" button isn't working/modal not opening correctly.
Files to Update: src/components/portfolio/AddCertificateForm.jsx
Issue Addressed: "the add certificate button itself not working" (This refers to its usage from PortfolioHome previously, and now CertificatesPage). The component itself seems fine, but let's provide its content for verification and to ensure consistency in styling.
Prompt for AI:

Plaintext

Please provide the complete content for `src/components/portfolio/AddCertificateForm.jsx`.
Ensure its styling and functionality for adding/editing certificates remains as provided previously, including proper file validation and submission via `onSubmit` prop.

**Reference files needed (context):**
- `src/context/ThemeContext.jsx`
- `src/components/common/Button.jsx`
- `src/components/common/Modal.jsx`
ðŸ“‹ STEP 6: Update components/portfolio/ExperienceTab.jsx
Goal: Fix the issue where experience page buttons aren't working (specifically, add/edit/delete from ExperienceTab).
Files to Update: src/components/portfolio/ExperienceTab.jsx
Issue Addressed: "even experience page no buttons are working"
Prompt for AI:

Plaintext

Please provide the complete content for `src/components/portfolio/ExperienceTab.jsx`.
Ensure its internal state management for showing/hiding the `ExperienceForm` modal, and `handleAddExperience`, `handleEditExperience`, `handleDeleteExperience`, `handleFormSubmit` functions are correctly implemented and integrated with `react-query` mutations.
Confirm all button actions (Add, Edit, Delete) correctly trigger their respective functions and update the UI.

**Reference files needed (context):**
- `src/config/index.js` (for `SummaryApi.experiences` endpoints)
- `src/components/portfolio/ExperienceCard.jsx`
- `src/components/portfolio/ExperienceForm.jsx`
- `src/components/common/Button.jsx`
- `src/components/common/Loader.jsx`
- `src/context/ThemeContext.jsx`
ðŸ“‹ STEP 7: Update components/portfolio/ProjectCard.jsx and components/portfolio/CertificateCard.jsx
Goal: Ensure these cards disable edit/delete actions when viewed on the public portfolio.
Files to Update:

src/components/portfolio/ProjectCard.jsx

src/components/portfolio/CertificateCard.jsx
Issue Addressed: "Projects (a grid of ProjectCards - ensure they don't show edit buttons)." and "Certificates (a grid of CertificateCards - ensure they don't show edit/delete buttons)."
Prompt for AI:

Plaintext

Please provide the complete, corrected content for `src/components/portfolio/ProjectCard.jsx` AND `src/components/portfolio/CertificateCard.jsx`.

For both components:
- Add a new `PropTypes.bool` prop called `isPublicView` (default to `false`).
- If `isPublicView` is `true`, the component should **hide or disable all edit, delete, and add-related buttons/links**. The "View Details" or "Verify Certificate" links should remain active.
- For `ProjectCard`, hide the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons. The "Details" Link should remain.
- For `CertificateCard`, hide the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons. The "Verify Certificate" link should remain.
- All other existing functionalities and styling must remain intact.

**Reference files needed (context):**
- `src/context/ThemeContext.jsx`
- `src/components/common/Card.jsx`
- `react-icons/fa` for icons.
- `prop-types` for validation.
ðŸ“‹ STEP 8: Address "Share" Button & Public Portfolio Link
Goal: Ensure the "Share" button correctly points to the public portfolio.
Files to Update: src/pages/portfolio/PortfolioHome.jsx
Issue Addressed: "the share button also not working..i think there should be a proper portfolio page right...the portfolio home we have now is where user is managing stuff..but wt we share to hiring manageres should be a different link right??? whichis public or with permisssions type?"
Action: This has already been addressed in Step 2.1 (PortfolioHome.jsx Update), where the profileActions for "Share" were changed to generate a link to /portfolio/public/:username.
Confirmation: The new PublicPortfolio.jsx component you will generate in Phase 1 (Step 3.6) is precisely that public, non-authenticated page.

Phase 3: Backend Developer API Structure (Instructions for Your Backend Developer)
Once you complete all frontend updates, send your backend developer the following revised prompt. It integrates the structure of the routes you provided with the functionalities we've confirmed and new needs.

Markdown

Hello [Backend Developer's Name],

The frontend development has reached a critical integration point. I've successfully refactored and organized the frontend based on our planned user flows and component purposes.

Now, we need to ensure the backend API endpoints are fully implemented and robustly support these flows. I've precisely outlined the API requirements below, matching them to the frontend's current implementation and future needs.

**Crucial Information for Implementation:**

* **Authentication:** All endpoints listed as "Protected" MUST require a valid JWT token.
* **File Uploads:** Endpoints handling file uploads (e.g., `companyLogo`, `image`, `resume`) will receive `multipart/form-data`. Ensure your Multer/Cloudinary middleware (`upload.js`, `uploadCertificate.js`, `uploadExperience.js`, `uploadProject.js`) correctly processes `req.file` or `req.files` as specified.
* **Response Structures:** Please adhere strictly to the outlined response structures to avoid breaking frontend.
* **Error Handling:** Implement consistent error responses (e.g., `res.status(400).json({ success: false, message: "..." })`, `401 Unauthorized`, `404 Not Found`, `500 Server Error`).
